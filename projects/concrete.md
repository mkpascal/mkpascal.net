Concrete is an innovative social app that encourages exploration and discovery. Developed as a personal project by a small group of friends, Concrete leverages the latest technologies to empower users to effortlessly unearth dynamic, exciting spots and share their adventures with a vibrant community of likeminded individuals.

At the core of Concrete's back-end is Rails 7. On the front-end, the app is built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework that delivers a seamless, high-performance experience for both iOS and Android users. To further enhance the discovery and user experience of place lookup, we've integrated GPT APIs alongside customized LLMs to provide personalized recommendations.
