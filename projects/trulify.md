I collaborated with a team to develop Trulify and FairLoan applications using Ruby on Rails. I also worked closely with payroll service bureaus to integrate custom APIs and successfully integrated a subscription billing system with Chargify. Furthermore, I integrated an SMS notification system with Twilio and performed the migration of the front-end framework from Bootstrap 2.3 to Bootstrap 3.0.

Additionally, I designed and implemented a server/client solution to securely manage the uniform data exchange with payroll service bureaus, handling sensitive PII including bank and income information.
