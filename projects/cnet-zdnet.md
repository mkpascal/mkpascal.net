I was in charge of keeping the internal CMS used by all internal brands up and running. I also took charge of the front-end features for both brands, including front door, articles, and ads. Furthermore, I continuously improved the CMS with new features and commerce-related functionalities.

Additionally, I excelled in debugging and investigating data requests, ensuring smooth operations. My role also involved API development for seamless front-end usage and handling updates to the internal support system with Jira integration. I actively contributed various CMS and commerce-related features. Moreover, I provided dedicated support for legacy brands to ensure their seamless integration into the system.
