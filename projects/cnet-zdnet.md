I had the responsibility of maintaining the internal CMS that was utilized by all our internal brands to ensure its continuous operation. I also took charge of the front-end features for both brands, including front door, articles, and ads. Furthermore, I continuously improved the CMS with new features and commerce-related functionalities.

My role also involved API development for seamless front-end usage and handling updates to the internal support system with Jira integration. I actively contributed various CMS and commerce-related features. Moreover, I provided dedicated support for legacy brands to ensure their seamless integration into the system.
