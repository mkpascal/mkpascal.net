I was in charge of keeping the internal CMS used by all internal brands up and running. Furthermore, I continuously improved the CMS with new features and entertainment-related functionalities.

Additionally, I excelled in debugging and investigating data requests, ensuring smooth operations. My role also involved API development for seamless front-end usage. I actively contributed to implementing a new video transcoding system and introduced various CMS features.
