I held the position of site engineer, overseeing the development of the internal CMS/API using Ruby on Rails. I successfully managed the migration of the entire stack from an internal datacenter to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Additionally, I handled the integration and migration of the User Account System, as well as the integration of Sendgrid for mail/queue management. I also facilitated the integration of Wordpress and took charge of managing the community forums and Apple News integration.

Furthermore, I implemented a Place System with 3rd party integration and dockerized the entire stack for improved scalability and deployment. In my role, I optimized server performance, including Apache and Redis, to enhance system efficiency. Moreover, I implemented a branching strategy for streamlined development and successfully carried out database and code optimization to improve overall performance.
