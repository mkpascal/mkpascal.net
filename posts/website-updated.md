It's been a while - but it was needed. I've just updated my personal website to highlight the projects I've accumulated throughout my career.

My website was previously running on an older Jekyll version. I've decided to bring it up to date by adopting Next.js, a React framework. I've also retained the previous articles, even if they may not perfectly align with today's tech world, and incorporated them into the new website.

With that said, I'm actively exploring site engineering opportunities, with a preference for Ruby on Rails positions in both back-end and front-end roles, contact me at my email: <pascalm@khot.us>.
